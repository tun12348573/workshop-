#### AWS Region used in this workshop

In this workshop, the system will be deployed in the following AWS Region:

```text
ap-southeast-1
```

This Region is **Asia Pacific (Singapore)** and is suitable for users in Vietnam because it provides lower latency compared to farther Regions.

Before starting, check the Region configured in AWS CLI.

```bash
aws configure get region
```

If the Region is not correct, configure it again:

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter the Region:

```text
ap-southeast-1
```

#### Check AWS account

Before deployment, check the AWS account currently being used:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

Expected result:

```json
{
  "UserId": "AIDAxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "Account": "451626662985",
  "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::451626662985:user/your-user"
}
```

If this command runs successfully, it means AWS CLI is connected to your AWS account.

#### Required tools

To deploy the project, your local machine needs the following tools:

- **Git** to clone the source code from GitHub.
- **Node.js** to install dependencies and build the frontend/backend.
- **AWS CLI** to interact with AWS from the terminal.
- **AWS SAM CLI** to build and deploy the serverless backend.
- **Visual Studio Code** to edit the source code.
- **GitHub account** to store source code and configure CI/CD.

Check Git:

```bash
git --version
```

Check Node.js:

```bash
node -v
```

Check npm:

```bash
npm -v
```

Check AWS CLI:

```bash
aws --version
```

Check SAM CLI:

```bash
sam --version
```

#### Clone the project source code

Clone the source code from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tun12348573/ecommerce-aws.git
```

Go to the project folder:

```bash
cd ecommerce-aws
```

Open the project with Visual Studio Code:

```bash
code .
```

#### Source code structure

The e-commerce project has the following main structure:

```text
ecommerce-aws/
├── backend/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── template.yaml
│   ├── package.json
│   └── samconfig.toml
│
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── public/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── vite.config.js
│
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│
└── README.md
```

Where:

- `backend/` contains Lambda source code, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Cognito, EventBridge, CloudWatch, and backend infrastructure resources.
- `frontend/` contains the customer and admin shopping website interface.
- `.github/workflows/` contains CI/CD workflows for automatic deployment.
- `template.yaml` is the AWS SAM / CloudFormation template used to define backend infrastructure.

#### Prepare backend environment variables

The backend needs several environment variables for payment integration, email notification, and system configuration.

Sample values:

```text
AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-1
STAGE=prod
APP_NAME=ecommerce-aws

ZALOPAY_APP_ID=your_zalopay_app_id
ZALOPAY_KEY1=your_zalopay_key1
ZALOPAY_KEY2=your_zalopay_key2
ZALOPAY_ENDPOINT=https://sb-openapi.zalopay.vn/v2/create

ALERT_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
```

Notes:

- Do not commit real secrets to GitHub.
- Keys such as `ZALOPAY_KEY1` and `ZALOPAY_KEY2` should be stored in GitHub Secrets or AWS Parameter Store / Secrets Manager for production deployment.
- In this workshop, ZaloPay Sandbox can be used to simulate online payment.

#### Prepare ZaloPay Sandbox

The project uses **ZaloPay Sandbox** to simulate online payment.

You need to prepare:

- ZaloPay Sandbox App ID.
- Key 1.
- Key 2.
- Sandbox endpoint.
- Callback URL after the backend is deployed.

Payment flow in this project:

```text
Customer Checkout
   ↓
API Gateway
   ↓
AWS Lambda
   ↓
ZaloPay Sandbox
   ↓
Payment Callback
   ↓
API Gateway
   ↓
Lambda
   ↓
DynamoDB Orders
```

After backend deployment, the callback URL will look like this:

```text
https://your-api-id.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/prod/payment/zalopay/callback
```

#### Prepare SNS alert email

The system uses **Amazon SNS** to send alert emails when errors or abnormal metrics occur.

The alert email used in this workshop can be:

```text
namdao110999@gmail.com
```

After deploying the stack, AWS will send a subscription confirmation email from SNS.

Open the email and click:

```text
Confirm subscription
```

If the subscription is not confirmed, SNS will not send alert emails.

#### Prepare SES for transactional emails

The project can use **Amazon SES** to send transactional emails, such as:

- Order confirmation email.
- Successful payment notification email.
- Cancelled order notification email.
- Refund notification email.

In the sandbox environment, SES requires you to verify an email address or domain before sending emails.

Preparation steps:

- Open Amazon SES.
- Select Region `ap-southeast-1`.
- Verify an email address or domain.
- Check the confirmation email from AWS.
- Confirm the verification.

Notes:

- If SES is still in sandbox mode, you can only send emails to verified email addresses.
- To send production emails, you need to request production access.
- If AWS requires domain verification first, you need to complete domain verification in SES.

#### Build backend with AWS SAM

Go to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the backend:

```bash
sam build
```

Expected result:

```text
Build Succeeded
```

#### Deploy backend with AWS SAM

Deploy the backend for the first time:

```bash
sam deploy --guided
```

Recommended values:

```text
Stack Name: ecommerce-aws-backend
AWS Region: ap-southeast-1
Confirm changes before deploy: y
Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation: y
Disable rollback: n
Save arguments to configuration file: y
SAM configuration file: samconfig.toml
SAM configuration environment: default
```

After confirmation, SAM will create AWS resources through CloudFormation.

The main resources created include:

- API Gateway HTTP API.
- Lambda backend function.
- Lambda scheduled functions.
- DynamoDB Products table.
- DynamoDB Orders table.
- DynamoDB Refunds table.
- Cognito User Pools.
- S3 Frontend Bucket.
- S3 Product Images Bucket.
- CloudFront Distribution.
- EventBridge Rules.
- CloudWatch Logs.
- CloudWatch Alarms.
- SNS Topic.
- IAM Roles and Policies.

The deployment process may take a few minutes.

#### Check CloudFormation stack

After deployment, open AWS Console:

```text
CloudFormation → Stacks → ecommerce-aws-backend
```

Expected status:

```text
CREATE_COMPLETE
```

If the stack has been deployed before, the status may be:

```text
UPDATE_COMPLETE
```

#### Get deployment outputs

After CloudFormation deployment is complete, open the **Outputs** tab to get important information such as:

- API Gateway URL.
- CloudFront URL.
- Frontend Bucket Name.
- Product Images Bucket Name.
- Cognito User Pool ID.
- Cognito App Client ID.

Example:

```text
API URL:
https://89yap0gq5k.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/prod

CloudFront URL:
https://dfjng6e5jz4mf.cloudfront.net
```

#### Configure frontend

Go to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create the frontend environment file:

```text
frontend/.env
```

Sample content:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://89yap0gq5k.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/prod

VITE_AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-1

VITE_CUSTOMER_USER_POOL_ID=ap-southeast-1_LHSScZri7
VITE_CUSTOMER_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=1uijbf07brda1p130293v3prfv

VITE_ADMIN_USER_POOL_ID=ap-southeast-1_k57hCsM4z
VITE_ADMIN_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=1qc3ttu4q3e95pk7mlqsivr66e

VITE_PRODUCT_IMAGES_BASE_URL=https://dfjng6e5jz4mf.cloudfront.net/uploads
```

Notes:

- Replace the values with the actual outputs from CloudFormation.
- Do not put secrets in the frontend `.env` file.
- The frontend should only contain public values such as API URL, Region, Cognito User Pool ID, and Client ID.

#### Run frontend locally

Run the frontend locally for testing:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the browser:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

Check the following functions:

- Homepage is displayed.
- Product list is displayed.
- Register / login works.
- API Gateway can be called successfully.
- Admin can log in.
- Cart and checkout work.

#### Build frontend

Build the production frontend:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be located in:

```text
frontend/dist
```

#### Upload frontend to S3

After building the frontend, upload the `dist` folder to the S3 Frontend Bucket.

Example:

```bash
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://ecommerce-aws-backend-frontendbucket-9wu7aid8okd8 --delete
```

Notes:

- Replace the bucket name with your actual frontend bucket.
- The upload folder is `dist/`.

#### Create CloudFront invalidation

After uploading the frontend to S3, create a CloudFront invalidation so CloudFront can serve the latest version:

```bash
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id E3EAY8XN54SSDX --paths "/*"
```

After a few minutes, open the CloudFront URL to check the website:

```text
https://dfjng6e5jz4mf.cloudfront.net
```

#### Prepare GitHub Actions CI/CD

The project can use GitHub Actions to automatically deploy the system when code is pushed to the `main` branch.

You need to prepare:

- GitHub repository.
- AWS IAM OIDC Provider.
- IAM Role for GitHub Actions.
- GitHub Secrets if needed.
- Workflow file in `.github/workflows/`.

Possible secrets:

```text
AWS_REGION
AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME
ZALOPAY_APP_ID
ZALOPAY_KEY1
ZALOPAY_KEY2
```

CI/CD flow:

```text
Developer Push Code
   ↓
GitHub Actions
   ↓
Assume AWS IAM Role using OIDC
   ↓
SAM Build & Deploy Backend
   ↓
Build Frontend
   ↓
Sync Frontend to S3
   ↓
Create CloudFront Invalidation
```

#### Check resources after deployment

After deployment is complete, check the following services in AWS Console:

- **CloudFormation**: stack status is `CREATE_COMPLETE` or `UPDATE_COMPLETE`.
- **S3**: Frontend Bucket and Product Images Bucket exist.
- **CloudFront**: distribution is enabled.
- **API Gateway**: API endpoint works.
- **Lambda**: functions are created.
- **DynamoDB**: Products, Orders, and Refunds tables are created.
- **Cognito**: customer and admin user pools are created.
- **EventBridge**: scheduled rules are enabled.
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Lambda log groups exist.
- **SNS**: email subscription is confirmed.

#### Images to prepare for the workshop

You can take screenshots of the deployment steps and save them in the following folder:

```text
static/images/5-Workshop/5.2-Prerequisite/
```

Suggested image names:

```text
iam-policy.png
